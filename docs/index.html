								<h2>The Project</h2>
							</header>

							<p align="left">After scrolling through Kaggle, I came across a notebook titled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ndalziel/who-goes-to-college" target="blank">who goes to college?</a> by
							<a href="hhttps://www.kaggle.com/ndalziel" target="blank">Nigel Dalziel</a>. His analysis used a Massachusetts public school
							<a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data"  target="blank">data set</a> to show, at the individual school level,
							that college attendance rates are negatively correlated with low income student enrollment. This project aims to expand upon Dalziel's previous work, and analyzes college attendance rates
							at the district level for all students as well as specific student populations. Additionally, I attempted to determine how district size and district type (charter vs non-charter) affect
							college attendance rates for these populations. Lastly, I fit a multivariate regression model to elucidate the most powerful variables in predicting college attendance 
							at the district level. <br /><br />
							Note: since the district level data was not publicly available on Kaggle, I used python to compile and prepare my data set from the MA DOE <a href= "http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/" target="blank">website</a>. 
							The Jupyter Notebook with this code as well as the Rmarkdown analysis notebook are linked below.

								<h2>Discussing the Results</h2>
							</header>
							<h3 align="left"> Exploratory Analysis</h3>
							<p align="left">One of the most important results from this analysis is that, when taking into account all districts in the state,
							college attendance rates for both low income (64%) and hispanic/latinx students (59%) are significantly lower than all (79%),
							white (80%), and black (74%) students. When stratifying for larger districts (> 500 grade 12 students), the differences between
							each groups' college attendance rates are similar, but each group has a lower college attendance rate. Larger districts in general
							send a lower percentage of students to college compared to the smaller districts. Charter schools send a larger percentage of students to college (85%)
							relative to the state average (72%). </p>
							<h3 align="left"> Multivariate Regression Model</h3>
							<p align="left">I fit a multivariate regression model to predict college attendance rates for all students excluding charter districts. The model
							was able to account for 60% of the variance in college attendance rates. After refining the model, the significant predictor
							variables were as follows: <b>1. SAT math scores, 2. Per pupil expenditure, 3. Net district spending relative to required spending,
							4. Percent of students completing advanced courses. </b>   </p>
							<h3 align="left"> Takeaways</h3>
							<p align="left"> This analysis does not provide insight as to <b>why</b> college attendance rates for low income and
							hispanic/latinx students are significantly lower compared to other groups. I believe that future research should take into account additional variables
							such as census/municipality data. Assuming that student desire to attend college is consistent across all districts, large districts seem to be failing
							students in terms of college attendance rates. There are not enough large districts in this data set to fit a multivariate regression for large districts, so I
							suggest future work tackle this problem with school-wide data instead. Lastly, it seems that district-level economics (net spending, per pupil expenditures) as well as
							advanced course completion meaningfully contribute to college attendance. It is not surprising that SAT scores are a significant predictor variable. While there is clearly much more work to be done, perhaps
							MA education administrators could utilize some of these insights and commission more extensive studies in order to improve post-graduate
							outcomes for MA public school students.
