While there are an endless amount of questions one could ask with this data, I was curious in answering three specific questions: 1. Can I use the data to accurately predict average SAT scores per district, and if so which variables hold the most weight? 2. Does racial diversity among staff and students affect enrollment by race in advanced courses / AP exams? 3. Do district funding and student/faculty race/ethnicity play a role in post-graduate outcomes (college attendance rate, private vs. public college attendances)?
