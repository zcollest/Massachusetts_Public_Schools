data description

- all data is separated by district, rather than by individual school
- data from 2017-2018 school year used since not all data is updated past that
- not every file contains data for every district, so the null values must be handled


GENERAL NOTES:

1. Basic exploratory data analysis (refer to kaggle link):
	- missing data, size of schools, outliers 
	- visualizing college graduate data 
	- correlation matrix as a diagnostic for regression analysis
	- hypothesis testing for differences in post-grad by race


2. Multivariable Regression Model / Classification
- regression analysis to predict post-grad outcomes (all students, black students, hispanic students)
	- must figure out how to choose the predictor variables (research this)
