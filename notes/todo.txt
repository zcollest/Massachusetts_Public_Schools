TO-DO

PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

1. Finish processing and cleaning up the data (determine issue with enrollment data)
2. Perform basic exploratory analysis (number of districts, visualize enrollment student/staff, SAT scores, advanced course participation, post-grad outcomes)
3. Perform data analysis:
	1. Can I use the data to accurately predict average SAT scores per district, and if so which variables hold the most weight? 
	2. Does racial diversity among staff and students affect enrollment by race in advanced courses / AP exams? 
	3. Do district funding and student/faculty race/ethnicity play a role in post-graduate outcomes (college attendance rate, private vs. public 	           college attendances)?
4. Present results and discuss findings

GENERAL:

1. Change column names in excel to make it more visually pleasing 
2. Investigate the outliers for funding or for other socioeconomic variables
3. Eliminate variables with not enough samples and potentially average some data together
